# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issue in Custom Component

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera preview fails to render correctly within a custom component. The preview intermittently displays a blank screen instead of the camera feed. This issue appears to be linked to asynchronous operations during the component's lifecycle.

## Bug Description
The Expo Camera API is integrated into a custom component. Under certain conditions, the camera preview fails to render, showing a blank screen.  The bug's behavior is inconsistent, sometimes working correctly and other times failing to render.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe that the camera preview may occasionally fail to render, resulting in a blank screen.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by ensuring that asynchronous operations related to the camera are properly managed within the component's lifecycle. Specifically, using the `useEffect` hook with cleanup function to ensure resources are released when the component unmounts prevents the issue.
